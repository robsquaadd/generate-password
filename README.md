# Generate Password

# Description

This project generates a randomized password given a set of criteria provided by the user. Those criteria are:
-- the number of characters the password should be so long as it's between 8 and 128 characters long.
-- if lowercase letters should be used.
-- if uppercase letters should be used.
-- if numbers should be used.
-- if special characters should be used.

The program then validates that the password meets the given criteria and then writes the output on the screen. If the output does not meet the criteria, then it will create a new password until a result is created that does meet the criteria.

This last point could introduce some variance in performance.
